I have worked on this code when started ideating solutions for L2 bitcoin few months back with Robin, supertestnet. Follow the whats app bitvm group and bitvm.org paper.

This code was me trying to comeup with frontend solution with zk using bristol circuits

I'm not envolved anymore only because I got other commitmments that held me from working on this.
